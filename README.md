# My Writing Workflow Tools

This set of tools is what I use to translate my writing --- in the
extended Pandoc Markdown format --- into the various forms needed for
sharing, publication, printing, etc. I built this Dockerfile and
reproducible set of tools so that I would never again have to do the
finicky work to configure a new Linux box to be able to build my
stuff.

Other than the Dockerfile, the files here aren't owned by me. I
included the binary releases for Pandoc and Calibre to make it easier
to build a consistent set of tools. Occasionally I may upgrade to
newer versions of these, but only when I feel it's needed. I won't
_have_ to do so based on which Linux I happen to be running.
